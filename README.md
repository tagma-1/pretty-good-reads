# PrettyGoodReads

This is a demo Rails application for planning, designing and building a review system that is loosely based on Good Reads.

## Planning

### User Stories

1. In order to find a new book to read, I want to be able to easily search based on the reviews and recommendations of other readers. 

2. In order to decide whether to read a particular book, I want to be able to easily find it and see its average rating and reader reviews.

3. In order to share my own views, I want to be able to conveniently sign up and easily leave reviews on books which I have read.
